// WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
// THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
// WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
// THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
// WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
// THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
